# Mario Jump

This project is a mini Mario game. Inspired by the game "T-Rex Running", the game is for old Mario fans.

## Appendix

The game is very simple, and very similar to "T-Rex Running". Your objective is to get as far as possible, passing the obstacles. The score will show your points. If you lose, you can start a new game by pressing the "Start New Game" button.
